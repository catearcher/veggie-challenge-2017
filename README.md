# NoVember 2017 Veggie Challenge

## The rules:
- You collect points for being veggie or vegan
  - Staying vegetarian for a full calendar day (midnight to midnight) earns you *1 point*
  - Staying vegan earns you *3 points* per day
- The goal is reaching *30 points in 30 days* (from November 1 to November 30)

This means that you can easily stay in the challenge even if you eat meat once in a while, as long as you balance it with a vegan day.

## More rules

- Don't be a dick - don't cheat
- If you're not sure if something is vegetarian: Look it up or ask. If that doesn't help then you have to assume that it is **not** vegetarian. So 0 points for that day, sorry.


## List of things that are *not* vegetarian

- Parmesan, Grana padano, and Gorgonzola
  - I know this totally sucks, but **all of those are not vegetarian** because they always contain rennet (which comes from slaughtered newly-born calves)
- Any Asian food with fish sauce in it
  - even if you order your meal with tofu, some restaurants still use fish sauce
  - it's best to check if the menu specifically says "vegetarian"; otherwise just ask
- Gelatin
  - Used in lots of cakes
  - If your cake has a transparent or half-transparent layer on top then it's probably gelatin
- Carmine ("echtes Karmin" in German)
  - Used for coloring in some types of candy
  - This is made from powdered insect bodies


## List of things that are *not* vegan

- Anything that is not vegetarian is also not vegan
- Honey
  - It comes from bees' butts
- Shellac
  - like honey it made by insects (but the insects aren't killed for it, so it's vegetarian)
  - used in some types of candy; if the candy has a firm but smooth surface, chances are that shellac is used for it
- Almost every single type of cheap candy and snacks
  - Cheap brands put milk powder in almost everything, even chips
  - More expensive brands are less likely to "cheat" by adding animal protein to stuff that doesn't need it


## Okay, so what *can* I cook and where *can* I go?

- Lots! I'm sure you'll find that there are plenty of things that don't involve killing animals
- Shameless plug: My girlfriend has a blog with hundreds of [vegetarian and vegan recipes](http://piximitmilch.at/archives/category/rezepte) and [restaurant tips](http://piximitmilch.at/archives/category/restaurants).
